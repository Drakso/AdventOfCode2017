        <h1>--- Part Two ---</h1>
        <p><br><br>"Great work; looks like we're on the right track after all. Here's a <span class="yellow">star</span> for your effort." However, the program seems a little worried. Can programs <span class="white">be</span> worried?
            
            <br><br>"Based on what we're seeing, it looks like all the User wanted is some information about the <span class="white">evenly divisible values</span> in the spreadsheet. Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind of calculation - most of us specialize in bitwise operations."
            
            <br><br>It sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.
            
            <br><br>For example, given the following spreadsheet:
            
            <br><br><span class="border">5 9 2 8
            <br>9 4 7 3
            <br>3 8 6 5</span>
            <br><br>In the first row, the only two numbers that evenly divide are <span class="border">8</span> and <span class="border">2</span>; the result of this division is <span class="border">4</span>.
            <br>In the second row, the two numbers are <span class="border">9</span> and <span class="border">3</span>; the result is <span class="border">3</span>.
            <br>In the third row, the result is <span class="border">2</span>.
            <br>In this example, the sum of the results would be <span class="border">4 + 3 + 2 = 9</span>.
            
            What is the <span class="white">sum of each row's result</span> in your puzzle input?</p>
            <h3>Input number:</h3>
            <textarea type="text" class="inputNumber" placeholder="Puzzle Input" rows="20"></textarea>
            <button class="btn btn-danger">GENERATE</button>
